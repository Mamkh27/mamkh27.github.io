  I have started a photography business called Rani Frames Photography. This hobby, among others, has been a passion of mine since
  I was handed a camera at ten years old. Creating a revenue stream out of a creative talent is an accomplishment I very much take pride in.

  About Me:
  <br>
  <br>
I came into UC Davis as a naive, young freshman who struggled to keep up with
the dynamic of a fast-paced college setting, and whose focus was just that, academia.
Five years later, I emerge as a zealous woman with a strong, entrepreneurial spirit. Grades became less
of a priority as I started to actually invest in the understanding of the vast processes in the CS world.
I plan to use this knowledge gained from the Computer Science and Engineering degree
to channel my creativity through projects and potentially a life-changing experience at a
company whose innovative vision aligns with mine.
<br>
<br>
As I have acquired direct experience with various operating systems and languages,
my general knowledge will complement the tasks that will be given under any creative front-end position.
Throughout my academic career as a computer scientist, I have engaged in various software
tools such as, working with Linux/Unix systems and GitHub. Actively engaging with these tools has
helped optimized my efficiency in terms of code-writing. I have also worked on various CS projects
that have helped me build up my logical and critical thinking skills associated with data structures and
general programming practices. One such project includes developing an emergency runway program in C++,
which helped me better understand and utilize object-oriented programming.
<br>
<br>
Along with programming languages, I am also proficient in front-end scripting languages, such as HTML5, CSS, and
JavaScript. To truly test my skills, I have applied these languages to construct a professional website for a
photography business from scratch. Of course, with further exploration and research, I have become familiar with
Javascript and its embedded processes
with HTML.
<br>
<br>
My willingness to learn and grasp concepts quickly has proven to be a valuable strength in the general workforce,
and will further bring immediate contributions to this position. Other strengths I will bring to the table
include my ability to pay attention to detail, take initiative, and provide strong communication skills.
 I pride myself on my professional and organizational skills, as well as my strong work ethic.
