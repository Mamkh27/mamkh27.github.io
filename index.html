  I have started a photography business called Rani Frames Photography. This hobby, among others, has been a passion of mine since
  I was handed a camera at ten years old. Creating a revenue stream out of a creative talent is an accomplishment I very much take pride in.

  <br>
  <br>
I came into UC Davis as a naive, young freshman who struggled to keep up with
the dynamic of a fast-paced college setting, and whose focus was just that, academia.
Five years later, I emerge as a zealous woman with a strong, entrepreneurial spirit. Grades became less
of a priority as I started to actually invest in the understanding of the vast processes in the CS world.
I plan to use this knowledge gained from the Computer Science and Engineering degree
to channel my creativity through projects and potentially a life-changing experience at a
company whose innovative vision aligns with mine. I plan to graduate Spring 2021.
<br>
<br>
I am currently a fifth-year engineering student who has also taken on a Technology Management Minor as a way to complement the major and general knowledge. As I have acquired direct experience with various operating systems and languages,
my general knowledge will complement the tasks that will be given under any creative front-end position.
Throughout my academic career as a computer scientist, I have engaged in various software
tools such as, working with Linux/Unix systems and GitHub. Actively engaging with these tools has
helped optimized my efficiency in terms of code-writing. I have also worked on various CS projects
that have helped me build up my logical and critical thinking skills associated with data structures and
general programming practices. One such project includes developing an emergency runway program in C++,
which helped me better understand and utilize object-oriented programming.
<br>
<br>
Along with programming languages, I am also proficient in front-end scripting languages, such as HTML5, CSS, and
JavaScript. To truly test my skills, I have applied these languages to construct a professional website for a
photography business from scratch. Of course, with further exploration and research, I have become familiar with
Javascript and its embedded processes
with HTML.
<br>
<br>
My willingness to learn and grasp concepts quickly has proven to be a valuable strength in the general workforce,
and will further bring immediate contributions to this position. Other strengths I will bring to the table
include my ability to pay attention to detail, take initiative, and provide strong communication skills.
 I pride myself on my professional and organizational skills, as well as my strong work ethic.

    <h1>EEC Smart Toaster System </h1>
    <h2>Embedded Systems</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
    With the use of software and hardware components, we built an embedded toaster system on the
     TI CC3200 LaunchPad interface. On trigger, the system turns on the conveyer belt which then dispenses a slice of bread into the toaster.
    We thoroughly designed, developed, implemented, and tested embedded software in support of project design.
    This project required the connection to Wi-Fi and Amazon Web Services to publish and subscribe to IoT topics.
    We were able to successfuly authenticate users and attach policies over AWS to establish a connection with iOS application in XCode.
The tools and languages used in this project include: Github, TI CC3200 LaunchPad, AWS, CCS, Swift, C, DTMF-tone decoding, GPIO-pin handling.

    <h1>Flashcards Application</h1>
    <h2>Web Programming</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
    I have built a flashcards application called "Lango" in my Web Development class from scratch.
    As the final project, the complexity of the project included the following tasks: creating a custom server
    to get and post requests and handle callbacks, a database to store user data and flashcards, and an attractive
    user interface for the user to make new flashcards as well as study old ones. This project required
    an embedded back-end/front-end dynamic interaction, requiring a decent understanding of all the concepts
    and technologies involved. The tools and languages
    used in this project include: React, Javascript, HTML5, CSS, AJAX, SQL, Github, UNIX.

    <h1>StudyLink</h1>
    <h2>iOS Front-End Dev</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
    From December 2018 - August 2019, I was the front-end software developer for the start-up founded at UC Davis.
    Some of my duties included, but were not limited to: using Swift 4 to build an iOS educational app,
    building the companyâ€™s strategy for using technological resources for creative marketing, and
    debugging old and installing new functionality for user convenience. Through this experience I self-taught
    majority of XCode interface as well as the Swift language. I utilized the
    Adobe suite to create all visuals for posters, marketing, and back-end talent search.
    As the sole front-end devleoper, it was essential to explore and implement effective UI Design and functions for targeted users.
    The tools and languages used in this position: Swift, OOP, XCode, Github, UNIX, Adobe Creative Cloud Suite.
